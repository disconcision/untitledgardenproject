# Agent Checklist

See docs/README.md for more basic workflow context.

**Before responding to user, verify:**

## Git

- [ ] On feature branch (not main)
- [ ] Atomic commits with conventional prefixes (feat/fix/refactor/docs/chore)
- [ ] Branch merged to main when complete
- [ ] Feature branch deleted

## Docs

- [ ] docs/TODO.md updated (claimed → complete)
- [ ] SOURCE.md updated if architectural change

## Tutorial

- [ ] If user-facing change: Added/updated tutorial step
- [ ] New steps marked `isNew: true`

## Quality

- [ ] Tested in browser (use browser tools)
- [ ] No lint errors (run `read_lints`)

**User will typically start sessions with Plan Mode** (`Shift+Tab`) for complex tasks.
Use built-in `todo_write` tool to track subtasks during work.
