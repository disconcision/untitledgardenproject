Historical documentation that's been superseded but retained for reference.

## CHECKPOINTS.md

Detailed checkpoint records from early development (CP-001 through CP-015).

This system was replaced by a simpler workflow in January 2026. The checkpoints contain:
- Tour paths for verifying features
- Architecture notes
- Detailed commit-by-commit history

**Still useful for**: Understanding how features were built, debugging regressions, archaeological reference.

**No longer maintained**: New work doesn't require checkpoint entries.
