# Sessions

Optional folder for Plan Mode output files.

When using Plan Mode (`Shift+Tab`), you can save the generated plan here:

```
docs/sessions/2026-01-05-audio-system.md
docs/sessions/2026-01-06-ui-polish.md
```

These files are useful for:
- Complex multi-step work where agents need persistent reference
- Tracking progress across long sessions
- Historical record of what was planned vs. executed

**This is optional.** For simple tasks, just use the built-in todo tool and don't create a file.
